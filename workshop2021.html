            The <strong>2021 CMU HoTT Graduate Student Workshop</strong> is a
            meeting to exchange ideas related to homotopy type theory, logic,
            and category theory. The workshop will consist of a series of
            presentations, with opportunities for discussion. All are welcome to
            attend. This event is meant to be friendly and informal, and talks
            on work in progress and unfinished ideas are welcome.

            <b>Caldwell &mdash; Sphere Bundles and Characteristic Classes.</b>
            Some of the most powerful techniques in algebraic topology revolve
            around the construction and manipulation of characteristic classes.
            In this talk, we will develop the basic theory of characteristic
            classes in homotopy type theory, focusing specifically on the Thom
            &amp; Euler classes developed for sphere bundles. As an application
            of this machinery, we sketch a proof of Serre's finiteness theorem
            of the homotopy groups of spheres.

            <b>Grossack &mdash; Categories, Modalities, and Type Theories: Oh
            my!</b> Category theory and logic have a tight interplay, with
            structured categories providing semantics for certain logics, and
            "internal logics" providing a useful language for speaking about
            structured categories. In this introductory talk we will survey both
            directions of this correspondence from the point of view of modal
            logic.
        </p>

            <b>Larrain Langlois &mdash; A Higher Inductive Presentation of the
            Integers.</b> The purpose of this work is to explore the higher
            inductive nature of the integers in the context of Homotopy Type
            Theory. We characterize it in terms of familiar category-theoretic
            notions and formalize the results in the proof assistant Agda. In
            particular, we formally verify that the integers are equal to the
            higher inductive type generated by a point and an autoequivalence.

            <b>Neumann &mdash; Allegories and Bisimulations.</b>
            <em>Functions</em> and <em>binary relations</em> are two of the most
            important concepts in modern mathematics. Basic category theory,
            accordingly, has the category Set of sets and functions and the
            category Rel of sets and binary relations as standard examples. But,
            of these two, Set is much more famous and Rel receives relatively
            little attention. And it's not hard to see why: Set possesses many
            of the canonical constructions in category theory ((co)limits,
            exponentials, a subobject classifier, etc.), whereas Rel, for the
            most part, doesn't. In this talk, I attempt to make the case that
            Rel has some interesting and worthwhile structure of its own, and
            put a name to some of its key features. This will take us on a tour
            through the theory of <em>allegories</em>, which are a kind of
            categorical structure articulating the essential features of a
            "category of relations". We'll see some interesting other examples
            of allegories, and use the allegory structure to define several
            notable classes of morphisms. I'll conclude by tracing a connection
            to several different kinds of (classical propositional) modal logic,
            and indicating interesting questions for further consideration.

            <b>Weinberger &mdash; A Yoneda Lemma for Synthetic Fibered
            ∞‑Categories</b>. In 2017, Riehl and Shulman have introduced
            simplicial homotopy type theory as an extension of HoTT, allowing
            for reasoning about ∞-categories. We present a notion of fibered
            ∞-category in this setting. As an application, we argue that this
            satisfies a Yoneda Lemma whose statement and proof follows
            Riehl&ndash;Verity's (much more general, but not per se homotopy
            type-theoretical) work on model-independent higher category theory.
            This generalizes Riehl--Shulman's work from discrete to categorical
            fibers. This is joint work with Ulrik Buchholtz.

            <b>Zwanziger &mdash; Lawvere's Law as an Elimination Principle for
            Identity Types.</b> As noted by Awodey (2016), the principle of path
            induction closely resembles Lawvere's Law (LL), Lawvere's
            category-theoretic characterization of equality. However, the
            iterated type dependency involved in path induction is puzzling from
            the perspective of LL. I argue that LL corresponds most closely to
            the principle of path recursion, including a propositional
            uniqueness principle. While path recursion is a priori weaker than
            path induction, I show that the two principles are equivalent,
            adapting an argument of Escardó (2015). Thus, identity types are
            completely characterized by LL.
