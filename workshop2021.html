            The <strong>2021 CMU HoTT Student Workshop</strong> is a meeting of graduate students affiliated with the Homotopy Type Theory group at CMU, to exchange ideas related to homotopy type theory, logic, and category theory. The workshop will consist of a series of presentations, with opportunities for discussion. All are welcome to attend; if you are interested in speaking, please contact Jonas Frey. This event is meant to be friendly and informal, and talks on work in progress and unfinished ideas are welcome.
